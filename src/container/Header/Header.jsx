              As a full-stack developer, I am passionate about designing interactive and responsive web and desktop applications. My expertise spans Java, C#, Asp.NET, JavaScript, React, SQL, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Docker, and Git. I am a quick learner, continuously expanding my knowledge and skill set. As a team player, I am eager to collaborate with others in the creation of outstanding applications. In 2016, I delved into coding and web development by crafting a channel management system. Since then, I've had the privilege of creating software for various entities, ranging from a small software house in Pakistan to a major corporation in Germany. I am driven by the belief that software development can be diverse and inspiring. With a mission to explore the possibilities of software design and development, I engage in experiments and thoughtful expressions. Currently, my primary focus is building products for my portfolio while working as an employee at STULZ Digital Solutions. I find the most satisfaction in crafting software at the intersection of design and engineering, where aesthetics meet functionality.
